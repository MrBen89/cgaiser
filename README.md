cgaiser

Turn photos into CGA graphics

🚀 Overview

cgaiser is a browser-based tool that converts your photos into old-school CGA-style graphics – think the palette and look of early PC graphics. I built this in about one hour, as a quick creative experiment, and tried to incorporate a Neo-Brutalist design aesthetic: bold typography, stark contrast, raw UI elements – minimal but purposeful.

🎨 Features

Upload a photo and convert it into a CGA-limited palette graphic

Works entirely in the browser (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)

Neo-Brutalist UI: strong contrasts, minimal décor, unapologetic presentation

Instant image conversion.

🧪 Why I built it

I wanted a fun way to play with retro graphics constraints and modern web tech

It was a quick creative sprint (~60 minutes) to explore palette-reduction algorithms + browser UI

I aimed to embrace a Neo-Brutalist design style to reflect the “rawness” of early computing graphics

📦 Tech stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (client-side only)

No back-end required – everything runs in the browser

simple palette reduction algorithm to create the CGA effect

❗ Limitations & Notes

It’s a prototype built very quickly → not production-grade

Works best with images that have strong shapes and contrast

The Neo-Brutalist styling means UI is minimal and may feel rough around the edges
